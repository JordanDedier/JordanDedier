- 👋 Hi, I’m @JordanDedier
- 👀 I’m interested in JavaScript coding (ReactJS, Angular & NodeJS), but with a heavier lean towards front end. Also, netowrking with folks as I'm an IT Recruiter in Canada!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the world of JavaScript at a beginner level.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the best way to learn with other beginners, and to network with Intermediate/Senior folks open to share learning resources as well as if you're looking for a new opportunitiy ;)  
- 📫 How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordan-dedier-81bb1448/
